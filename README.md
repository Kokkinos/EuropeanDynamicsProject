# EuropeanDynamicsProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.1.
It's only an attempt for an assignment that I was given.This is not a complete project.
This project has the following problems:<br/>
1)Navigation to PostsComponent does not work via url.I think that is a problem of the subscribe method inside the App component.<br/>
2)When the project reloads it does not fetch the users by default.I have to remove the /users from the url to fetch them, although this is the path for the UsersComponent. 


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
